**Read the passage** itself in several different translations. (Obviously, read the Hebrew/Aramaic or Greek if you can; but this guide presupposes that you read in translation.) Read the passage aloud. What happens for you when you read it? What questions do the several translations raise for you?

*Big Idea:* "The Bible is in Hebrew/Aramaic and in Greek." What you read is not the Bible, but a translation. (I know, I say below in any case that "There's no such thing as the Bible," but bear with me.) Every translation you read is an interpretive act, undertaken by an individual or a committee of individuals, all with their own biases about the Bible and what the Bible is likely to say. Reading several translations allows you to, perhaps, "triangulate" toward cruxes of interpretation: manuscript variants, or hard-to-understand words and phrases, or ideas that some translators wish to avoid or smooth over. Whatever is going on, though, it's going on in the Hebrew/Aramaic or the Greek "behind" your translations.
