**Read the passage** itself in several different translations. (Obviously, read the Hebrew/Aramaic or Greek if you can; but this guide presupposes that you read in translation.) Read the passage aloud. What happens for you when you read it? What questions do the several translations raise for you?

Here are some translations to get you started. You are welcome to go find more.

Remember, our goal is not to find a translation that "you like" (one that soothes and tickles your presuppositions and biases). Rather, our goal is to find what kinds of questions are raised for you concerning the original Hebrew/Aramaic biblical text, and its meanings for its author(s) and the community to whom it was first written.
