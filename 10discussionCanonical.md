**Do similar texts or themes appear elsewhere in the canon?** Is there a "canonical discussion" (testimony and counter-testimony) going on? If so, what are the issues and what are the positions of the present text on those issues? Resist any temptation to "smooth out the differences": the library we call "the Bible" is characterized by competing theologies and by perspectives that change over time.
