**Locate the historical setting of the composition** of the text, and the situation to which the text was written, as far as is possible. This is not the world "in" the text, but the world "behind" the text: the world that produced the text. What was going on? What is "bugging" the text in its social-historical world, and what does it want to happen there? What does this information contribute to interpretation of the text?
