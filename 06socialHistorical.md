**Locate the historical setting of the composition** of the text, and the situation to which the text was written, as far as is possible. This is not the world "in" the text (as with narrative criticism), but rather the world "behind" the text: the world that produced the text. What was going on? What is "bugging" the author in his social-historical world, and what does he want to happen there? What does this information contribute to interpretation of the text?

Consider briefly the following: To create a text, in this ancient world, was an enormously *expensive* undertaking:

* The resources were expensive, beyond the reach of those outside the structures of palace or Temple. 
* The materials were scarce: even a professional scribe might handle a text (like the Exodus) only a few times in his life, dedicating that time to *memorization* rather than interpretation.
* The skills were the work of a lifetime: only a hereditary scribal elite, sponsored by palace or Temple, could devote a lifetime to memorizing vast authoritative scrolls, copying dilapidated scrolls accurately, and--for a few accomplished veterans--editing previous texts and creating new ones.

Against this background, consider the historical period. Again, concentric circles may help: there is the post-exilic period; within that, there is the period after Alexander's conquest; within that, there is the period of the rule of Antiochus IV Epiphanes; within that, there is the period beginning with his organized suppression of Judaism in Jerusalem. Read what you can on this. Resources include:

* Textbook;
* Relevant entries in your one-volume Bible dictionary;
* Other traditionally-published resources in your local libraries, your church, and your home;
* Responsibly-assessed internet resources like Wikipedia or the results of Google searches.

Post in the exegesis forum according to the instructions there. This week is a "fishbowl" discussion.

Stage One, completed by Wednesday morning 9:00 am: 

In the Stage One discussion thread, let the Group negotiate to choose two (2) volunteers to have their own discussion (in Stage Two) about the social-historical background of Daniel 8. 

Stage Two, lasting through Friday morning 9:00 am: 

Volunteers: Replying to this thread, let the two volunteers have their own discussion around these questions: When was Daniel 8 written, and how do we know? What was happening, and what people or groups were the major "players"? What conflicts were underway, with what at stake? What position(s) are the "Daniel 8 group" taking on this "field of play"? What do they want to happen in their own time? How do the details of the text reflect their position? What do they seem to be trying to make happen with their text, and how so?

Remaining Group members: During this period, the rest of the Group is having a back-channel engagement on Twitter, using the hashtags #11500x and #xgrpA (or #xgrpB for Group B, #xgrpC for Group B, etc., depending on your Group). Keep a running back-channel going in response to the primary discussion. What catches your interest? What questions of clarification do you have? What threads do you hope to pick up in Stage Three? 

Stage Three, lasting through Monday morning 9:00 am:

Switch places. Let the back-channel folks from the last stage pick up a discussion here, replying to this thread and "moving things forward" on topics of interest or areas not yet covered. Let the volunteers from the last stage pick up the Twitter back-channel, responding to continuing developments here in the forum.

Stage Four, until Tuesday morning 9:00 am:

Reply here with any concluding reflections, follow-ups, etc.

You will probably find it helpful to "subscribe" to this forum (see upper left): when you subscribe to an exegesis-project forum, you will receive emails when members of your own small group contribute posts.
