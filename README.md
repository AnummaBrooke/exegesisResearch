# Guide to Researching an Exegesis Project

***

These are the steps by which I break down exegetical research for my Masters students in biblical studies. By "exegesis," I mean "determining the likely meaning of a text in its original social-historical context." 

Included also is an explicit element of "hermeneutics," in its limited sense of "determining some range of possible meanings that the text might support for particular reading communities today."
