**If a parallel biblical text exists**, compare and contrast the passage with its parallels. What is the same? What is different? Are there consequences for your exegesis? (Examples of closely parallel texts are Exod 20:1-17 with Deut 5:6-21; and, 2 Sam 22:2-51 with Psa 18. Examples of more loosely parallel texts would include the "synoptic" accounts of the arrest, trial, and crucifixion in Matthew, Mark, and Luke.)
