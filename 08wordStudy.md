**Conduct studies of the important words** in the passage.

* Important rule: *Take Nothing For Granted*, especially concerning familiar English words (what do the words mean in the literary context of your passage?).
* Examine the words in two respects: their background in the ancient Near East and in the Bible, and their use in the particular text at hand. 
* *Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament* is a valuable resource for Hebrew words and roots, but try to be aware of its exegetical biases (e.g., 19th-century German Liberal Protestants decide what words are "theologically significant") and its relative lack of linguistic basis (e.g., "theological significance" is not a linguistic category). In other words, treat it as the confessional theological work that it is.
* Beware the "etymological fallacy" (e.g., English "decimate" no longer means, "kill one tenth." So too are the meanings of Hebrew words not determined by etymology).
* Remember that words mean what they mean *in a particular literary context*. (They don't mean their entire semantic range in every instance.)
* Do other passages cast light on the use of the word in the passage before you?
