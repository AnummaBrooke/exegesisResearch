**Determine for yourself** the limits of passage's immediate literary context. Where does it start? Where does it end? Question the divisions of verses and paragraphs in the translations. Why do you think so? What indicators of literary genre are helpful in this regard? *Let the material tell you what its boundaries are. Be suspicious of chapter and verse numberings.*

Genre: For example, a narrative may be divisible into episodes; those episodes may be divisible into their own beginnings, middles, and ends. Or, a legal code may be divisible into sections of like laws (or not); those sections, divisible into laws; a law, divisible into statements like "If such-and-so happens" and "Then you shall respond thusly."

Circles: It may be helpful to think in terms of concentric circles. For example, a dialogue, within an episode, within a narrative, within a cycle of narratives, within a biblical book. Or, an "If this happens" statement, within a law, within a series of like laws, within a legal code, within a biblical book.

**Stage One, due Friday morning, 9:00 am:** By some means, represent the place of our assigned passage (Daniel 8:9-14) within its context: what is its place within a larger, immediate literary context? What is that a part of? Etc. You may use an outline format, written directly into your post. Or draw a picture using concentric circles, uploading your image as an attachment to an explanatory post. *Either way, be explicit, explaining your choices: what makes you see the boundaries that you see?*

**Stage Two, due Tuesday morning, 9:00 am:** Comment constructively on the work of at least three (3) of your small group colleagues. In 250-300 words, tell them where you think they succeed, and why; tell them also where you see room for improvement, and why.

You will probably find it helpful to "subscribe" to this forum (see upper left): when you subscribe to an exegesis-project forum, you will receive emails when members of your own small group contribute posts.
