We have talked about "exegesis" as "the meaning of the biblical text for its likely author and for the community to whom that author wrote in their own social-historical circumstances."

"Hermeneutics," then, for our purposes, can be described as "the range of possible meanings that the text might support for our own, contemporary, reading communities."

**Can you suggest some hermeneutical possibilities** of the text for the life of the church and the situation of the world today? This should be clearly based on your exegetical and theological analysis. *(You should, for clarity, have a particular group or situation in view.)* If your theological analysis of the text has concluded that some of its claims are inappropriate or unintelligible, what can you say about the text to the modern church and world? *Avoid platitudes*! 

Tips:

* First, keep your one, select group or situation clearly in view, as opposed to "the church" more broadly conceived. You can't visualize "the church"; you can visualize a particular local community in a specified set of circumstances.
* Second, your hermeneutical possibilities should follow recognizably from the fruits of your exegesis and your theological assessment of the passage. Don't just "start from scratch": engage your exegetical results.
