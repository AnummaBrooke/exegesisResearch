**Can you suggest some hermeneutical possibilities** of the text for the life of the church and the situation of the world today. This should be clearly based on your exegetical and theological analysis,? *(You should, for clarity, have a particular group or situation in view.)* If your theological analysis of the text concludes that its claims are inappropriate or unintelligible, what can you say about the text to the modern church and world? *Avoid platitudes*! 

* First, keep your one, select group or situation clearly in view, as opposed to "the church" more broadly conceived.
* Second, your hermeneutical possibilities should follow recognizably from the fruits of your exegesis and your theological assessment of the passage.
