**Note: Exegesis is a dynamic and *iterative* process** which cannot be reduced to a step-by-step procedure. It is useful, however, to have a place to begin and a direction in which to go. Persons in the early stages of doing exegesis according to a step-by-step pattern like the one suggested here will find that the later steps will often force revisions of conclusions reached in earlier steps.
