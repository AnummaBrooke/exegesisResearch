**Check for textual-critical problems** (variants among the textual witnesses), and for words/phrases with unclear meaning, using the translation footnotes and commentaries. If any seem to affect the sense of the passage, investigate them. Remember that textual-critical problems can often be solved only in light of the exegesis as a whole.

*Big Idea:* "There's no such thing as the Bible." That is, there is no one correct "Bible" somewhere under a glass globe, against which can compare variants or translations for accuracy. There are only manuscripts, no two quite alike, and translations that may reflect other variants, no two quite alike. What you read as "the Bible" is already some particular set of informed scholarly judgment calls concerning the hypothetical original utterances that lie behind this array of variants.
