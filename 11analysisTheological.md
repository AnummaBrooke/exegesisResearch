**Analyze the passage theologically** in light of your exegetical research. What are the major theological claims of the passage? (e.g., What does it say or presuppose about God, about the nature of God’s activity in the world, about people, about human community, about any particular human groups, about the so-called “natural world,” etc. How are God, humans and the world presented in relation to one another?)

(From Williamson and Allen, _A Credible and Timely Word_ [St. Louis: Chalice, 1991]:)

* In your view, are these claims appropriate to your understanding of God's merciful call and ethical claim?
* In your view, are these claims credible? That is, are these claims:
    + coherent to other biblical witness? How or how not? What if they are not?
    + intelligible in the light of the way the world is understood today? How or how not? What if they are not?
    + moral? Why or why not? What if they are not?
